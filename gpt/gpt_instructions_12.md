Given below is the implementation of an app written in Flutter and a backend written as a Lambda Function.

Analyze it carefully.

I'm like to have the provided dart files documented somehow (don't document the Python file - that's added only for reference)
In Python the standard is to add a triple quoted string in the top of the file - I hope it's similar for dart.

Don't repeat the file content in you output - just the descriptions together with sufficient information on where I should put it.
