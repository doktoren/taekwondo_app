Given below is the full implementation of an app written in Flutter and a backend written as a Lambda Function.

Analyze it carefully.

Currently there is a problem with the data provider.
More precisely I observe a problem when having the app installed as a web app on my iPhone that the updated state is not propagated when updating the participation to a training session. That is; it doesn't work shortly after having opening the app. But it does start to work after some time - as if something is not being properly initialized.

I cannot reproduce the problem when simply navigating to the web page in a browser.
It also seems to work fine when installed as an Android app.

What is the problem and how can it be fixed?

If anything is unclear or you need more context the please ask before proceeding
- this is important! I've noticed that you proceed with a solution even though
I've sometimes forgot to add a file.

I'd like you to procedure the full content of the files you modify or add.
